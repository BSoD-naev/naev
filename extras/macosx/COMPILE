Quick Start
-----------

1. Make sure universal binaries of SDL.framework, SDL_mixer.framework, SDL_image.framework, FreeType.framework, libxml.framework are in /Library/Frameworks. Also, the platforms folder should be on the same level as the src folder.

2. Open naev.xcodeproj in XCode.

3. Select the "Active Build Configuration" to "Debug" or "Release". [*]

4. Hit the Build button.

5. Copy the ndata file into naev.app/Contents/Resources

6. Double click and start playing.

[*] If you use "Debug", the executable will be using the "dat", "ai", "snd", "gfx", etc folders for data instead of the ndata packfile. Xcode will run a script that automatically creates these links, but that means you MUST NOT move the naev.app at "build/Debug/naev.app" or the links won't work and naev will crash at launch.

If you use "Release", you will need the ndata packfile available at the naev website. See README for details.

Notes
-----

This build requires Mac OS X 10.5 because it uses the libpng.dylib that comes by default on leopard.

The SDL, FreeType and libxml frameworks are copied into the binary. 

The build process runs a script (located in the scripts folder) to change the library search paths of the resulting binary so it searches inside the bundle rather than /Library/Frameworks

This version of SDLMain.m uses the Resources folder as the local path, rather than in the directory the .app is located in, so the Resources folder is where you will store the ndata.
