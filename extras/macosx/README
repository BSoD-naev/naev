NAEV 0.4.0 beta-1 FOR MAC OS X
-----------------------

This version is a universal binary, requiring MAC OS X 10.5+. It will not run on OS less than 10.5 because it uses a library that comes with the MAC OS X 10.5 operating system, specifically libpng.

IMPORTANT!
----------

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLACING GAME DATA FILE. MUST READ!
---------------------------------------------------

To run naev.app, place the ndata file to naev.app/Contents/Resources. You can open up naev.app as a folder by right clicking and selecting "Show Package Contents".

You can probably get ndata from wherever you downloaded NAEV - It should be located at
http://naev.googlecode.com/

PLAYING
-------

Start the game by double clicking the "naev" icon in this folder.

First time running the game will take a long time to start up (just over a minute on my Macbook Pro) while the game generates some graphics.  These, along with save games are stored in a hidden directory in your home directory (~/.naev/).  NAEV plays nicely with the system - it does not create or modify any files outside of the ~/.naev directory.

UNINSTALL
---------

Just delete the naev.app and ~/.naev to completely remove NAEV from your system.
The NAEV team hope you enjoy the game and report any bugs.

PROBLEMS
---------
If it is crashing on launch and you are running Mac OS X 10.5, intel or ppc, please open up Console.app, copy and paste the error message from naev and email to lericl.mailbox@gmail.com with "naev mac" somewhere in the subject. Thanks!
