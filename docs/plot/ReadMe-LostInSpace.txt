Read Me for the Lost in Hyperspace story arc

CONTAINS SPOILERS

Synopsis:

The player begins to receive messages after exiting hyperspace that their time in hyperspace was longer than the ship's computer expected. If the problem remains unresolved, a hyperspace jump will not end well. The player will not enter the expected destination. They are trapped in hyperspace, where they are surrounded by debris and other ships(derelict) that have been trapped.

Ships can briefly be seen transiting through hyperspace, but they can't be hailed. The player is hailed by a communications satellite, informing them that there is another person in hyperspace. Dr. Talbot Mallory, is the last survivor aboard the Empire science vessel 'Sharanya'. 

<the following has not been implemented>

He's been trapped in hyperspace for 5 years, and in that time deployed the satellite the player encountered and has been studying the trajectories of ships passing through hyperspace.

He believes he has identified various exit nodes, but they can't be clearly detected and he lacks the equipment. The player must scavenge equipment from derelict ships and debris for him.

After running the gofor missions, Dr. Mallory is able to launch (one? more?) devices that reveal areas in hyperspace that are exits. To open one of these areas requires a lot of energy, so the Dr. boards your ship and slaves the 'Sharanya's' systems to your ship. Once near a exit point, the Dr. overloads the 'Sharanya's' engines, letting the player successfully exit hyperspace.

The player exits into a random system. Upon returning to civilization, govts snatch up the Dr. and spirit him away (Empire is especially interested in him) and the pilot gets a sizable reward.

To do:
     -Make missions that let the player repair their engines to avoid getting trapped
     -Place a planet/astroid in hyperspace. It's where the Dr. is.
     -Make the missions to loot the derelicts
     -The entire exit of hyperspace and pilot payoff needs to be done.
     -Need graphics compatible with NAEV license for commSat and Science vessel

Problems:
     -Can't figure out how to place backgrounds in a system
     -The outfit that modifies hyperspace time only works if player has an open slot. Would be great if there could be outfits that don't need slots and are grated/removed by events.
